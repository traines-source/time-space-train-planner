  /timetable/plan/{evaNo}/{date}{hour}:
    get:
      description: |
        Returns a Timetable object (see Timetable) that contains planned data for the specified station (evaNo) within the hourly time slice given by date (format YYMMDD) and hour (format HH). The data includes stops for all trips that arrive or depart within that slice. There is a small overlap between slices since some trips arrive in one slice and depart in another.
        
        Planned data does never contain messages. On event level, planned data contains the 'plannned' attributes pt, pp, ps and ppth while the 'changed' attributes ct, cp, cs and cpth are absent.
        
        Planned data is generated many hours in advance and is static, i.e. it does never change. It should be cached by web caches.public interface allows access to information about a station.

  /timetable/fchg/{evaNo}:
    get:
      description: |
        Returns a Timetable object (see Timetable) that contains all known changes for the station given by evaNo.
        
        The data includes all known changes from now on until ndefinitely into the future. Once changes become obsolete (because their trip departs from the station) they are removed from this resource.
        
        Changes may include messages. On event level, they usually contain one or more of the 'changed' attributes ct, cp, cs or cpth. Changes may also include 'planned' attributes if there is no associated planned data for the change (e.g. an unplanned stop or trip).
        
        Full changes are updated every 30s and should be cached for that period by web caches.
      parameters:

  /timetable/rchg/{evaNo}:
    get:
      description: |
        Returns a Timetable object (see Timetable) that contains all recent changes for the station given by evaNo. Recent changes are always a subset of the full changes. They may equal full changes but are typically much smaller. Data includes only those changes that became known within the last 2 minutes.
        
        A client that updates its state in intervals of less than 2 minutes should load full changes initially and then proceed to periodically load only the recent changes in order to save bandwidth.
        
        Recent changes are updated every 30s as well and should be cached for that period by web caches.

          * a 6-digit date specifier (YYMMdd) that indicates the planned departure date of the trip from its start station.
          * an index that indicates the position of the stop within the trip (in rare cases, one trip may arrive multiple times at one station). Added trips get indices above 100. 
          Example '-7874571842864554321-1403311221-11' would be used for a trip with daily trip id '-7874571842864554321' that starts on march the 31th 2014 and where the current station is the 11th stop.

          * 'p' = this event was planned (also used when the cancellation of an event has been revoked)
          The status applies to the event, not to the trip as a whole. Insertion or removal of a single stop will usually affect two events at once: one arrival and one departure event. Note that these two events do not have to belong to the same stop. For example, removing the last stop of a trip will result in arrival cancellation for the last stop and of departure cancellation for the stop before the last. So asymmetric cancellations of just arrival or departure for a stop can occur.

  junctionType:
    description: |
      The enumeration describes the junction type of a stop.
      
      Regular trains don't have any special junctions so all their stops have JunctionType.NONE. However, wing trains have SPLITs and JOINs at certain locations within their paths. And "Durchbindung" trains have TRANSITIONs, i.e. locations where the train changes its train number and/or category.
      
      Example for a wing train:
      
      Train ICE 123 starts at Munich towards Frankfurt. Train ICE 456 starts at Stuttgart towards Frankfurt. Both trains arrive at the same platform in Frankfurt and are joined (coupled together). The joined train departs from Frankfurt and proceeds to Hannover. In Hannover the trains get split up again into its two constituent parts: ICE 123 and ICE 456. Train ICE 123 departs from Hannover towards its destination Hamburg. Train ICE 456 departs from Hannover towards its destination Berlin. In this case, the stop at Frankfurt would have JunctionType.JOIN and Hannover would have JunctionType.SPLIT.
      
      Example for a "Durchbindung" train:
      
      Train "RE 98765" departs from Mannheim towards Frankfurt. The train arrives as "RE 98765" in Franfurt but departs under the new name "RB 77665" towards Fulda. In this case, the stop at Frankfurt would have JunctionType.TRANSITION.
      
      * t - TRANSITION
        This stop is a transition station of a 'Durchbindung' train, i.e. the same physical train arrives under one train number/cetegory and departs from this stop under a different train number/category. A transition is represented graphically by a horizontal line with a dot in the middle.
      * s - SPLIT
        The wing train is split at this stop, i.e. two (or more) trains arrive coupled together as a single train, are split at this stop and depart as separate independent trains on different routes. Those independent trains might or might not be joined again later. A split is represented graphically by one line that is split into two (when viewed from left to right).
      * j - JOIN
        The wing train is joined at this stop, i.e. two (or more) trains arrive independently on different routes,  get coupled together and depart from this stop as a single train. That joined train might or might not be split again later. A join is represented graphically by two lines that are joined into one (when viewed from left to right).
